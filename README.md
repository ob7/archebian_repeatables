<h2>Archebian Repeatables</h2>
<p>
Repeatables refers to an element that is repeated by adding or substracting them via the blocks edit form.<br>
What makes this package special is in the options menu you can toggle what kind of elements you want to repeat, whether it be images or links, or a combination.<br>
This makes it so one block can do the job of what typically would be mutliple blocks, saving us great time in our web development process.

I just started on this package and the description above is the end goal, not what the code actually does at this point.
